    <h2>Expectation document</h2>
    <p> By taking this course, I aim to deepen my knowledge and sharpen my hands-on skills from the ground up. My goal is to confidently build and deploy complete applications independently by the end of the course.

        Additionally, Iâ€™m eager to master tools like the React framework and become highly proficient in them. I believe this course will play a key role in helping me achieve my long-term career goal of becoming an expert frontend developer and unlocking better job opportunities.</p>
